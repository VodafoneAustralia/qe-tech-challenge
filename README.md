Welcome to our Quality Engineering Technical challenge. The purpose of this challenge allows you to demonstrate your skills and show us why you are the one.

## The Challenge

Currently, we are running project [SuperHeroes and SuperVillain](https://github.com/users/ale-sanchez-g/projects/1). This is running in a Kanban Board and some tasks need to be completed before our big release.

Currently, the application is made of a Basic HTML front end that connects to different services with GraphQL and Rest APIs.

To be successful in this challenge you need to provide the below:

- Report any Defects in a DEFECT.md file in this repo
- Web automation framework to regression test https://responsivefight.herokuapp.com/
- API automation framework to regression test https://supervillain.herokuapp.com/api-docs/

### Extra Points

- Find security vulnerabilities and report them.
  - Also, create a user in the game with more than **4000** points in the [leaderboard](https://responsivefight.herokuapp.com/leaderboard)
- Run your test in a CI that can be accessed by anyone
- Integrate your test with a Visual Validation tool
- Integrate your CI execution with a public slack channel


## Guidelines

Use **your preferred programming language**. However, our preferred programming language is **Javascript**.

### Steps

- Create your own Github repository and make [asanchezgiraldo](https://github.com/asanchezgiraldo) a read-only collaborator.
- Create a README.md file explaining how to execute your test.
- Complete within 3 days of your interview.
